# Static App Skeleton

## Overview
This skeleton is for creating and deploying a one page static html/js/css app.  It uses a bunch web technologies to help workflow, organization and rapid development.

It uses:
* [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) as it's MVC.
* [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) as it's css pre-processor.
* [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as it's task runner.
* [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) as it's dependency manager.
* And several packages come pre-installed to help out with things (Bootstrap, jQuery, lodash, BrowserSync, Font Awesome and more)
